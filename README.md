## ‚úÖ **How did you integrate Zipkin into your microservices?**

> " integrated **Zipkin** with our Spring Boot microservices for **distributed tracing** to track requests as they flowed across different services."

---

### üîπ **Step-by-Step Integration:**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Add Spring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin Dependencies (in each service)**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure Zipkin in `application.yml`:**

```yaml
spring:
  zipkin:
    base-url: http://zipkin-server:9411
  sleuth:
    sampler:
      probability: 1.0  # Trace 100% requests in non-prod
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Start Zipkin Server:**

* We deployed the Zipkin server via Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Run Services**

* Each microservice automatically generates and propagates **trace IDs** and **span IDs** using **Sleuth**, and sends them to Zipkin.

## ‚úÖ **What Insights Did Zipkin Provide?**

> "Zipkin helped us **visualize the full request path** across services ‚Äî like from `API Gateway` ‚Üí `OrderService` ‚Üí `InventoryService` ‚Üí `NotificationService` ‚Äî including timestamps and latency at each step."

### üîç Key Insights:

* Which microservice was slow (latency bottleneck)?
* Which service failed during the request (error traces)?
* How long each service took to process a part of the request
* Whether Kafka communication or DB queries were slowing things down

> It drastically reduced our **debugging time** in production and staging environments.

### ‚úÖ One-Liner Summary:

> "I integrated Zipkin with Spring Cloud Sleuth to trace requests across microservices, helping us identify latency bottlenecks, service failures, and improve observability."
